# Decentralized Medical Equipment Maintenance

A blockchain-based solution for transparent, efficient, and compliant management of medical equipment throughout its lifecycle, ensuring patient safety and optimal healthcare delivery.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create an immutable record of medical equipment registration, maintenance schedules, repair history, and compliance verification. By decentralizing this critical information, the platform reduces equipment downtime, enhances patient safety, ensures regulatory compliance, and optimizes the allocation of maintenance resources across healthcare facilities.

## Core Components

### 1. Device Registration Contract

The device registration contract creates a permanent digital identity for each medical device:
- Records essential device information (manufacturer, model, serial number, installation date)
- Stores technical specifications and operational parameters
- Maintains ownership and location history
- Links to digital copies of operation manuals and warranty information
- Generates unique blockchain identifiers for each device
- Tracks device lifecycle stage (new, active, under maintenance, retired)
- Manages certificate of authenticity for equipment verification

### 2. Maintenance Scheduling Contract

The maintenance scheduling contract manages preventive care and calibration:
- Implements manufacturer-recommended maintenance schedules
- Automatically triggers maintenance alerts based on usage or time intervals
- Assigns qualified technicians based on expertise and certification
- Tracks maintenance history and compliance
- Adjusts scheduling based on equipment usage patterns and performance data
- Handles rescheduling and prioritization for critical equipment
- Provides predictive maintenance recommendations based on historical data

### 3. Repair Tracking Contract

The repair tracking contract documents equipment issues and resolution:
- Records problem reports with standardized categorization
- Tracks repair status through defined workflow states
- Documents parts replaced and repair procedures performed
- Calculates downtime metrics and repair cost analytics
- Implements approval workflows for major repairs
- Maintains complete repair history for equipment lifecycle analysis
- Identifies recurring issues across device models or manufacturers

### 4. Compliance Verification Contract

The compliance verification contract ensures adherence to safety standards:
- Monitors maintenance and repair activities against regulatory requirements
- Validates technician certifications and authorizations
- Generates compliance reports for regulatory submissions
- Tracks calibration verification and accuracy testing
- Implements audit trails for inspection readiness
- Manages end-of-life and decommissioning procedures
- Alerts stakeholders to regulatory changes affecting specific equipment
